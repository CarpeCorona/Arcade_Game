# Classic Arcade Game
This is a variation of the classic arcade game, "Frogger."

<br>

## Frogger Clone
The object of this game is to get your character from one side of the map to the other.
The difficulty rises as you clear your way to the top each time because the bugs will get faster.

<br>

## No-install just open and play
This game plays straight out of the web browser of your choice.
Simply open up the index.html file into whichever web browser you choose and start playing.
This game runs with the current ES6 JavaScript classes and will run on all browsers except IE currently.

<br>

## How to play
To play the game all you have to do is use the arrow keys to move your character up and down or left and right.
You may also use the WASD keys to move while trying to dodge bugs and make it to the top of the map.
Each time you reach the top the bugs will run 10% faster and each time you die you will lose 1 point and they will slow down.

## Contributing
Currently my copy of the game is simple but I would like to add a competitive two player mode.
It could also use some skin modes, I am hoping to add in a Halloween skin come Oct 31 this year.
This would allow the game to have maybe ghosts running across the map instead of bugs and the such.
